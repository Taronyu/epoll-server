# epoll-server
A sample epoll TCP server implementation in C. This is my first GitHub project,
so please have mercy ;-)

## Compiling
A simple Makefile is included. If you have gcc installed, just run the supplied
Makefile:

```
cd path/to/epoll-server
make
```

When specifying `DEBUG=1`, the debug configuration will be used.
